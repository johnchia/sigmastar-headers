/*
 * i6_aud.h -- MI_AI (audio input) ABI for SigmaStar Infinity6E
 *
 * Layouts and symbol names come from divinus's src/hal/star/i6_aud.h
 * (MIT), independently corroborated by waybeam's star6e_audio.c, which
 * declares the same device-config and frame structs field for field.
 *
 * That corroboration matters because the vendored SigmaStar MI_AI
 * reference (ref/sigmastar-docs, MI AI API 2.19) documents
 * MI_AUDIO_Attr_t with a *different field order* -- eBitwidth first,
 * then eSamplerate, eSoundmode, eWorkmode, u32PtNumPerFrm, u32ChnCnt.
 * Those docs are for SSD20X, a different chip generation, so the doc is
 * the authority on **semantics** (what the fields mean, what values are
 * legal, what the calls guarantee) and the two references are the
 * authority on **layout** for this SoC. Do not "fix" the field order to
 * match the documentation.
 *
 * CAPTURE ONLY. There is deliberately no MI_AO here and no AI encoder:
 *
 *   - Nothing in scope plays audio out, so libmi_ao is never loaded.
 *   - MI's own encoder (MI_AI_SetAencAttr / EnableAenc / DisableAenc) is
 *     unused. divinus dlsym's all three and has zero call sites for any
 *     of them; waybeam does not load them at all. Both capture raw PCM
 *     and encode in userspace, and so does raptor -- rad has its own
 *     G.711/L16/Opus/AAC encoders. Omitting them keeps the symbol set to
 *     what is actually called.
 *   - The VQE / AEC / ANR / AGC / EQ / AED / SSL / BF entry points exist
 *     in libmi_ai.so but their implementations do not: the algorithm
 *     packs (IaaXxx_*, MI_AED_*, the SDK-side G711 and G726 helpers) are
 *     declared **weak undefined**, so they resolve to NULL rather than
 *     failing the link.
 *     Calling into them would jump to address 0. See hal_audio.c's OP
 *     COVERAGE comment.
